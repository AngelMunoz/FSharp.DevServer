Perla is a cross-platform single executable binary CLI Tool for a Development Server of Single Page Applications (like vite/webpack but no node required!).

If that sounds like something nice, [Check The docs!](https://perla-docs.web.app/)

## Status

The current ***The v1.0.0*** is taking place in the dev branch, please check it out, also the releases tab contains the most recen betas to try out!

## Existing tools

If you actually use and like nodejs, then you would be better taking a look at the tools that inspired this repository

- [jspm](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli) - Import map handling, they are the best at manipulating import maps :heart:
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)

These tools have a bigger community and rely on an even bigger ecosystem plus they support plugins via npm so if you're using node stick with them they are a better choice
Perla's unbundled development was inspired by both snowpack and vite, CDN dependencies were inspired by snowpack's remote sources development
