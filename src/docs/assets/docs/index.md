# Perla Dev Server

The simplest cross-platform dev server you will find.

Our Belief is that you shouldn't be obligated to learn node.js to develop a **SPA** (Single Page Application) you should be able to:

- Install a tool.
- Run the tool.
- Develop your SPA.
- Build your production ready SPA.

If you are learning or are a seasoned developer, the priority should be on your application, not the tooling around it.

Perla leverages the blazing fast **Go** and **.NET** ecosystems to give you a simple and effective development server.

- Transpile on the fly:

  - Typescript
  - Javascript
  - JSX
  - TSX

- Use import maps to pick npm dependencies from reliable CDN's like
  - [Skypack]
  - [JSPM]
  - [Unpkg]
