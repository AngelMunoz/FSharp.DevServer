# Perla Dev Server

The simplest cross-platform dev server you will find.

Our Belief is that you shouldn't be obligated to learn node.js nor have a complex toolchain to develop a **SPA** (Single Page Application). In a few words you should be able to:

- [Install] a tool.
- [Run] the tool.
- Focus on your your SPA.
- [Build] your production ready SPA.

If you are learning or are a seasoned developer, the priority should be on your application, not the tooling around it.

Perla leverages the blazing fast **.NET** and **Go** ecosystems to give you a simple and effective development server.

### How do Perla projects look like?

Check the [perla samples] where you can projects written in:

- Javascript (Lit)
- Typescript (Lit)
- JSX (React, and Preact)
- TSX (React, and Preact)
- F# (Feliz, Sutil)

Also For F# users, we have a [Real World Fable] implementation in fable-react from the days of fable 2.0 revived with Perla tooling.
