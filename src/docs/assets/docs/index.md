# Perla Dev Server

The simplest cross-platform dev server you will find.

Our Belief is that you shouldn't be obligated to learn node.js nor have a complex toolchain to develop a **SPA** (Single Page Application) you should be able to:

- [Install] a tool.
- [Run] the tool.
- Develop your SPA.
- [Build] your production ready SPA.

If you are learning or are a seasoned developer, the priority should be on your application, not the tooling around it.

Perla leverages the blazing fast **Go** and **.NET** ecosystems to give you a simple and effective development server.

- Transpile on the fly:

  - [Typescript]
  - [Javascript]
  - [JSX]
  - [TSX]

- Use [import maps] to pick npm dependencies from reliable CDN's like
  - [Skypack]
  - [JSPM]
  - [Unpkg]
