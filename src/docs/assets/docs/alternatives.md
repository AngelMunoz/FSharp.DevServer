# Alternatives

The very inspiration for this project are:

- [Snowpack]
- [Vite]

And at the same time they are the more complete alternatives.

Why do I say "_More Complete_" alternatives? We live in a world dominated by Javascript when it comes to web tooling, when [esbuild] came to the picture was when people started looking into creating tooling for javascript outside the javascript language.

These projects support Javascript Plugins, and that means support for things like `sass`, `less`, `pug`, `vue files`, and other cool things we're unable to support just yet.

If your projects are complex enough or need these kinds of assets don't hesitate to take a look at them, although they are cross-platform as well they require node.js tooling which is something we don't require at all.
